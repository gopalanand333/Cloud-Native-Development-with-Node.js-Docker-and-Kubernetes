# Cloud-Native-Development-with-Node.js-Docker-and-Kubernetes
While the majority of Node.js apps are deployed and run in the cloud, few leverage all the modern cloud computing features. In this repository you can find how do develop Cloud Native apps with Node.js

## Learning Objectives:
- Using Node.js in the cloud
- Creating a Node.js app
- Building a production Dockerfile
- Deploying an app to Kubernetes using Helm
- Adding self-healing capabilities
- Building custom charts and graphs
- Adding support for metrics and request tracking

## Microservices
"An approach to developing a single application as a suite of small services, each running in its own process and communicating with lightweight mechanisms often an HTTP resource API"
This enables services to be independently scalable.

# Cloud Native Technologies
Cloud native technologies empower organizations to build and run scalable applications in modern, dynamic enviornments such as public, private, and hybrid clouds. These techniques enable loosely coupled systems that are resilient, manageable, and observable.

`It's all about how applications are created and deployed, not where`
 
 If we take an application and just deploy it to a cloud, it's not cloud native, it's just cloud hosted. For it to be a cloud native application, it needs to be a small, lightweight service, it needs to be independently deployable and scalable but most importantly, it needs to exploit the capabilities that the cloud provides.



## Node.js in the cloud
- Node.js has the right characteristics
- Is being deployed "cloud first"
- But is mostly being cloud hosted.

# Cloud Native JS(https://www.cloudnativejs.io/)


### to install the basic structure of express use the command 
```express <appname>```
This will generate an application with basic setup that is cloud ready.
use ```npm intalll`` to install all dependencies then 
```npm start``` to start the application.
