# Cloud-Native-Development-with-Node.js-Docker-and-Kubernetes
While the majority of Node.js apps are deployed and run in the cloud, few leverage all the modern cloud computing features. In this repository you can find how do develop Cloud Native apps with Node.js

## Learning Objectives:
- Using Node.js in the cloud
- Creating a Node.js app
- Building a production Dockerfile
- Deploying an app to Kubernetes using Helm
- Adding self-healing capabilities
- Building custom charts and graphs
- Adding support for metrics and request tracking

## Microservices
"An approach to developing a single application as a suite of small services, each running in its own process and communicating with lightweight mechanisms often an HTTP resource API"
This enables services to be independently scalable.
